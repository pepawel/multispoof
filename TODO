natman:
- execute_command_long with empty input gives two element tab
v whats with nth match - done

netdb:
- add min_age variable to netdb:
  - gethost will return data only when host age is good
- gethost should allow to specify miminal age of host to get
  - if age of that host is lower then do not serve it
  - cmac should look at age
  - deta when replying to arps should also look at it
  - find all gethost command executions in code

- implement connection limit
- fix bug which shows when
	there is too much input data
- when tx cannot start,
  pipeline should be stopped, but
  it isn't - why? - eof case

multispoof:
- pass to all rx instances bpf filter which
  blocks invalid addresses (224.0.0.0, 169.254.0.0 etc.)

cmac:
- something wrong, when pingin one of ourself addresses - check it
  - when pinging 192.168.64.97
  cmac (spoof): debug: host '124.191.192.168' not in db
