Make tapio separate mini-project (modify to add multiplatform support)

Modify nth match (only iptables part) to support more than 100 rules
- submit patch

Create mode of address harvesting which exploits static-arp-on-gateway
setup. Send something from random mac and get reply from gateway,
which has static arp entry for this IP. Remember IP and use it.

Add netfilter DROP rules on physical interface, so dhcp-client
would not interfere with multispoof (it won't communicate, so
it won't assign ip address to physical interface).

In Makefile: make dependency between multispoof target and Makefile.
It will make install process idiot proff, when someone modify install
paths in Makefile after compilation.

Make debian livecd with multispoof installed (+libpcap CVS and
nth netfilter patch) to make testing easier.

Add Makefile target for binary packages creation with checkinstall
(deb, rpm).

natman, conncheck:
- use WIFEXITED, WIFSIGNALLED (man system), WEXITSTATUS
  to check exit status of iptables invocations.

general:
- connections initiated from network to spoofed hosts don't work:
  - it is because tap interface doesn't have ip aliases set up.
  - only outgoing connections works
- there should be some mechanism to shutdown multispoof
  is one of its processes end.
  - set -e + trap on ERR
  - hijack SIG_CHLD signal

deta:
- add support for netmask in banned ip list (to ban all networks
  like 169.254.0.0/16)

netdb:
- fix memory leak (rss grows when ./test-netdb runs)
- implement connection limit
- fix bug which shows when
	there is too much input data
- when tx cannot start,
  pipeline should be stopped, but
  it isn't - why? - eof case

multispoof, all:
- use getopt for command line options parsing

cmac:
- something wrong, when pingin one of ourself addresses - check it
  - when pinging 192.168.64.97
  cmac (spoof): debug: host '124.191.192.168' not in db
