setsid and other things every gentle daemon should do

Maybe add sysctl tuning to main script?

Performance is not good - profile and optimize.

Resetting connections which are using dead addresses.
For example:
1. User starts download.
2. NAT assigns IP for this transmission.
3. While transmission is running, the IP being used becomes active.
4. Multispoof detects that, and blocks that IP (at cmac level).
5. After a while, the IP is removed from NAT.
6. The connection is still alive, but every packet is dropped.
The connection should be ended with tcp reset or ICMP message,
so that client won't wait too long for timeout.

Add runtime checks for tools existence, nth & owner matches,
SNAT & DNAT etc.

all components:
- use getopt for command line options parsing

deta:
- add support for netmask in banned ip list (to ban all networks
  like 169.254.0.0/16)
- rethink banned list concept

general:
- there should be some mechanism to shutdown multispoof
  if one of its processes end.
  - set -e + trap on ERR
  - hijack SIG_CHLD signal

natman, conncheck:
- use WIFEXITED, WIFSIGNALLED (man system), WEXITSTATUS
  to check exit status of iptables invocations.

netdb:
- implement connection limit
- fix bug which shows when
	there is too much input data

cmac:
- something wrong, when pingin one of ourself addresses - check it
  - when pinging 192.168.64.97
  cmac (spoof): debug: host '124.191.192.168' not in db

Make tapio separate mini-project (modify to add multiplatform support)
