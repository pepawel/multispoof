general:
- connections initiated from network to spoofed hosts don't work:
  - it is because tap interface doesn't have ip aliases set up.
  - only outgoing connections works

deta:
- add support for netmask in banned ip list (to ban all networks
  like 169.254.0.0/16)

netdb:
- fix memory leak (rss grows when ./test-netdb runs)
- implement connection limit
- fix bug which shows when
	there is too much input data
- when tx cannot start,
  pipeline should be stopped, but
  it isn't - why? - eof case

multispoof, all:
- use getopt for command line options parsing

cmac:
- something wrong, when pingin one of ourself addresses - check it
  - when pinging 192.168.64.97
  cmac (spoof): debug: host '124.191.192.168' not in db
