Obsolete documentation!

demux:
	listen on nic and tun interfaces and forward packets, changing
	MAC address according to internal IP, MAC table.

	Internal IP, MAC table is read from local socket given as argument.
	This socket is monitored (using select()) - when new data arrives
	internal table is rebuild.
	Protocol on this socket (example):
	stop - stops forwarding packets
	start - starts forwarding packets
	clean - removes all entries in table
	add 192.168.1.1 00:11:22:33:44:55 - add new entry
	delete 192.168.1.1 - delete this entry
	show - shows internal table with counters
	quit - closes connection

demux is controlled thru socket by process that watches network
and keep inactive hosts database. demux can also be monitored
by stats generator.

How to discover working demux:
- scan each host in network - if there are too many identical
  hosts, then it is suspicious
- sniff traffic - look at IP IDs, tcp sequence numbers, site
	visited - and corelate all of this
- sniff traffic and watch how many hosts are up and transferring
	data (example timeline: no tranfers, then all hosts are contacting
	with one site, then no tranfers again)
